    <h1>What is a queue?</h1>
    <h2> A queue is used for storing and managing data in a specific order.<br> It follows the principle of “First in, First out” (FIFO), where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. </h2>

    <h2><ul> 
        <li>For task scheduling in operating systems </li>
        <li>Task scheduling in operating systems </li>
        <li>When you want to get items out in the same order that you put them in, use a queue </li>
    </ul></h2>
       
    <h4>Example of declaring a queue in Java:</h4>

      <h4> <i>A queue is implemented just like a linked list, except the head and tail are constantly changed due to the adding and removing of nodes.</i></h4>
