    <h1>What is a hashmap?</h1>
    <h2> A HashMap is a data structure used to store key-value pairs. It allows for the efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion of any entry based on its key. HashMaps achieve this efficiency by using a function called a hash function, which converts the key into an index of an array in which the values are stored. </h2>

    <h3>When would you use a hashmap?</h3>
    <h2><ul> 
        <li>Useful when we need efficient implementation of search, insert and delete operations.</li>
        <li>Database indexing: Hashing is used to index and retrieve data efficiently in databases and other data storage systems. </li>
        <li>Search algorithms: Hashing is used to implement search algorithms, such as hash tables and bloom filters, for fast lookups and queries.</li>
    </ul></h2>
