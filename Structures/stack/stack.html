    <h1>What is a stack?</h1>
    <h2> A stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. <br>The order is usally LIFO(Last In First Out), which implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first.</h2>

    <h3>When would you use a stack?</h3>
    <h2><ul> 
        <li>Undo/Redo Operations</li>
        <li>Depth-First Search (DFS) in graphs and trees </li>
        <li> Browser History</li>
        <li>When you need to bring things out in the opposite order that they were put in, use a stack  </li>
    </ul></h2>

    <h4>Example of declaring a stack in Java:</h4>
    <img src = "example1.png" alt = "stack example1"><br>
    <img src = "example2.png" alt = "stack example2"><br>
    <img src = "example3.png" alt = "stack exmaple3">
